To make the transaction section togglable, we need to understand the context in which this feature is to be implemented. Since no specific language or framework was mentioned, I will assume we are working with a web application and will provide a generic solution using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

PLANNING:
1. We will need an HTML element that represents the transaction section. This could be a `div` with a specific id or class.
2. We will need a button or a similar element that the user can interact with to toggle the visibility of the transaction section.
3. We will write JavaScript code that adds an event listener to the button. When the button is clicked, the JavaScript will toggle a class on the transaction section that controls its visibility.
4. We will add CSS rules for the visibility class to show and hide the transaction section.

OUTPUT:
Since we are creating new content, we will need to create new files for the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

```html
new_file.html
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<title>Toggle Transaction Section</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>

<!-- Toggle Button -->
<button id="toggleButton">Toggle Transactions</button>

<!-- Transaction Section -->
<div id="transactionSection" class="hidden">
    <!-- Content of the transaction section goes here -->
</div>

<script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
>>>>>>> updated
```

```css
new_file.css
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
#transactionSection {
    /* Initial styles for the transaction section */
}

.hidden {
    display: none; /* This class will be toggled to show/hide the transaction section */
}
>>>>>>> updated
```

```javascript
new_file.js
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    var toggleButton = document.getElementById('toggleButton');
    var transactionSection = document.getElementById('transactionSection');

    toggleButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
        transactionSection.classList.toggle('hidden');
    });
});
>>>>>>> updated
```

This code provides a basic toggle functionality. When the user clicks the "Toggle Transactions" button, the `hidden` class is toggled on the `transactionSection` div, which controls its visibility based on the CSS rules defined.
